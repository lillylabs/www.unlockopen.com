title: Industry leaders explain the benefits of contributing to open source
---

> "Technology leadership is not defined by patents […]
but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers.
We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents
will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard."

—Elon Musk, CEO, Tesla

> "We know that this recruiting angle works.
3/4 of our new engineers say that our open source program
positively affected their decision to join the company."

—James Pearce, Head of the Open Source Program, Facebook.

> "We believe in the power of communities
to achieve more together than what their members can do on their own,
and that collaborative development through the open source process can accelerate innovation."

—Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft

> "Open source helps us retain and attract talent.
People, the new generation especially,
get their street creds from submitting to open source."

—Tom Soderstrom CTO/CIO for IT, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA

> "In order to keep a killer developer happy,
you have to help them become more attractive to other employers.
But that’s ok, because that’s exactly the kind of developer you want to have working for you.
So relax and let them work on open source or they’ll go somewhere else where they can."

—Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder and ex-CEO, GitHub
